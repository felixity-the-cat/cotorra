1. We start with [MIMIC data](https://mimic.mit.edu) that's been converted to the
   [CLIF standard](https://clif-icu.com):
   https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-ext-clif. We first collate and tokenize
   it with the [cocoa package](https://github.com/bbj-lab/cocoa).

   ```sh
   cocoa pipeline \
       --processed-data-home ./processed/dev \
       --verbose
   ```

2. Next we train a model on this data (with hyperparameter tuning):

   ```sh
   cotorra tune \
       --processed-data-home ./processed/dev \
       --output-home ./output/dev/ \
       --verbose
   ```

3. You can get generative predictions with:

   ```sh
   cotorra generative-score \
       --processed-data-home ./processed/dev \
       --model-home ./output/dev/mdl-cotorra-tuning \
       --verbose
   ```

4. You can get representations of the initial parts of the sequences and
   rep-based predictions with:

   ```sh
   cotorra extract \
       --processed-data-home ./processed/dev \
       --model-home ./output/dev/mdl-cotorra-tuning

   cotorra rep-based-score \
       --processed-data-home ./processed/dev \
       --model-home ./output/dev/mdl-cotorra-tuning \
       --verbose
   ```
