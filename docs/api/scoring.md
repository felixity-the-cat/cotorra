# Scoring

Scoring turns a trained model into per-timeline outcome predictions. Cotorra
offers two complementary approaches, both driven by a `scoring.yaml`
configuration and both operating on the held-out split: generation-based
scoring, which lets the model simulate the future directly, and
representation-based scoring, which fits a classifier on extracted features.
In each case the `target_tokens` glob patterns in the configuration select
which vocabulary tokens count as outcomes of interest.

## `GenerativeScorer`

`GenerativeScorer` predicts outcomes by *generating* them. Using the
[`quick_sco_re`](https://pypi.org/project/quick-sco-re/) implementation of the
SCORE and REACH algorithms, it autoregressively samples many possible
continuations of each timeline and estimates the probability that a target
outcome token occurs. For every outcome it reports three Monte-Carlo estimates —
a raw occurrence score (`mc`), a SCOPE score, and a REACH score — computed only
for subjects who have not already experienced the outcome. Generation runs
asynchronously in batches and the scores are written to a parquet file.

## `RepBasedScorer`

`RepBasedScorer` predicts outcomes from the representations dumped by the
[`Extractor`](extraction.md#extractor). It loads the extracted feature vectors
for the train, tuning, and held-out splits, fits a supervised classifier per
outcome token to predict whether that outcome occurs, and writes the held-out
predicted probabilities to a parquet file. The classifier family is chosen with
[`EstimatorType`](#estimatortype); it errors with a helpful message if the
features are missing, prompting you to run `cotorra extract` first.

## `EstimatorType`

`EstimatorType` enumerates the classifier families available to
[`RepBasedScorer`](#repbasedscorer): k-nearest-neighbors, LightGBM (the
default), XGBoost, and several logistic-regression variants (plain,
standardized/z-scored, and cross-validated). It exists so the choice of
estimator can be passed as a plain string on the CLI or in configuration.
